Register your OhmPi
===================

If you want your system to appear on the map of OhmPi and be part of the OhmPi family, you can `register your OhmPi <https://framaforms.org/ohmpi-registration-form-1731060017>`_. This will also enable you to receive notification when a new version of the hardware/software is available.
